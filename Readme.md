### Fintech Developer Exam Instructions

Your goal is to display a table on a webpage that showcases portfolio and fund composition details for each day. Follow the instructions below:

#### **Task Overview**
1. Use the JSON artifacts generated by the `Portfolio Publisher` and `Fund Compositions` repositories.
2. Fetch historical stock prices for the relevant tickers on each date using an open-source stock price API.
3. Compute and display the value of each fund based on the stock prices and proportions.

#### **Sample Table**
Hereâ€™s an example of the desired table layout:

| Date       | Fund Name | Total Value | Breakdown                       |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| 2024-12-20 | Fund A    | $1,200.50   | AAPL: $600.25, GOOG: $600.25   |
| 2024-12-20 | Fund B    | $850.75     | MSFT: $595.53, AMZN: $255.22   |

#### **Steps to Complete**
1. Clone the repositories `Portfolio Publisher` and `Fund Compositions` generate your own tokens to fetch data from actions.
2. Generate artifacts using their respective GitHub Actions.
3. Use the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) (or another open-source stock price API of your choice) to fetch stock prices for the relevant tickers on each date. Sign up for a free API key.
4. Calculate the total value of each fund:
   - For each fund, multiply the `units_owned` by the sum of `(stock price * proportion)` for all tickers in the fund.
5. Build a webpage that:
   - Displays the data in a table format as shown above.
6. Write a brief explanation of your approach and any assumptions you made.

#### **Requirements**
- Use any solution for the frontend
- Demonstrate the data modeling solution
- Create tests to ensure incoming data is in correct format
- Fetch data dynamically from the generated JSON artifacts and API

#### **Submission**
1. Submit your code as a GitHub repository.
2. Include a `README.md` file in your repository with:
   - An overview of your solution.
   - Setup instructions.
   - How to run your code.

Feel free to ask questions or clarify assumptions as needed. Good luck!
